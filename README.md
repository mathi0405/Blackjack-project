# Blackjack-project
A simple, text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. This command-line game allows you to play a classic game of Blackjack against the computer. The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack, where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of the popular card game Blackjack, also known as 21. The game is designed to be played in the terminal or command prompt, making it an easy and fun way to practice Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and list operations.

## Features

- **Random Card Dealing:** Cards are dealt randomly from a standard deck.
- **Blackjack Logic:** The game correctly handles the rules of Blackjack, including the special case for a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card).
- **User Input:** The user can decide whether to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (end their turn).
- **Computer AI:** The computer will automatically draw cards until it reaches a score of 17 or higher.
